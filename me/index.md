# Me

A dreamer with a lot of projects on my head and hearth.

I have 3 main goals. 

- Support and doing my best on the job like I wish my doctor do.
- Be kind with my Family and enjoy as much as possible remembering the short life is.
- Grow the knowledge and curiosity,
  sharing it as much as possible thinking I'm helping to the society to get closer on that day when we will go far in the universe.
